This is the maximum possible profit that we can earn. Note that we cannot sell both the 3rd and 4th items as they have the same unique id. Hence, 25 will be returned as the output.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Example 2:</h3>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input: input1 = [1,2,1], input2 = [10,20,30], input3 = 3\r\nOutput: 60</code></pre>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> We can sell all the 3 items and earn a total profit of 10 + 20 + 30 = 60. This is the maximum possible profit that we can earn. Note that we can sell the 1st and 3rd items having the same UniqueId as they are not consecutive. Hence, 60 will be returned as the output.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code class='language-javascript'># Read only region start\r\nclass UserMainCode(object):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def maximiseprofit(cls, input1, input2, input3):\r\n        # input1 : int[]\r\n        # input2 : int[]\r\n        # input3 : int\r\n\r\n        # Expected return type : int\r\n        # Read only region end\r\n        # write code here\r\n        pass\r\n</code></pre>",
