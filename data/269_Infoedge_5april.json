However, there's a time constraint - John must complete his apple-gathering mission before the neighbor returns, which will be after H hours.</p>\r\n<p>There are n apple trees in the garden, each with a different yield of apples denoted by <code>apples[i]</code>. John can pick <code>m</code> apples per hour. If a tree has fewer than <code>m</code> apples, John will move on to the next tree.</p>\r\n<p>Your task is to determine the smallest value of <code>m</code> that allows John to gather as many apples as possible under the given conditions without alerting the neighbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Input format</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The initial line specifies an integer <code>n</code>, denoting the quantity of apple trees.</li>\r\n    <li>Subsequently, in the following sequential lines, the array elements of apples are presented, where <code>apples[i]</code> signifies the count of apples on the <code>i</code>th apple tree.</li>\r\n    <li>The next line contains <code>H</code> hours, which is the time frame after which the neighbor will visit his garden.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Output format</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The output is a single integer, i.e., <code>m</code> representing the smallest value by which John can gather as many apples as possible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examples</h2>\r\n<h3>Example 1:</h3>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input:\r\n5\r\n30\r\n22\r\n13\r\n4\r\n9\r\n9\r\nOutput: 7</code></pre>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the above example, we have:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>n = 5 (The array contains 5 elements)</li>\r\n    <li>apples = [30, 22, 13, 4, 9]</li>\r\n    <li>H = 9</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If we take m=7,</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>For apples[0]=30, we can gather (30/7) = 4 hours (28 apples taken).</li>\r\n    <li>For apples[1]=22, we can gather (22/7) = 3 hours (21 apples taken).</li>\r\n    <li>For apples[2]=13, we can gather (13/7) = 1 hour (7 apples taken).</li>\r\n    <li>For apples[3]=4, we can't gather any apples from this tree since (4/7)=0, so we will skip this tree.</li>\r\n    <li>For apples[4]=9, we can gather (9/7)=1 hour (7 apples taken).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>So, within the allocated 9 hours, John managed to gather a maximum of 63 apples.</p>\r\n<p>Hence, the smallest value of m that allows John to gather as many apples as possible is 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Constraints</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= n <= 10^4</code></li>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= apples[i] <= 10^8</code></li>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= H <= 10^9</code></li>\r\n</ul>",
