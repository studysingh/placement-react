        "problem_statement": "<h1>Dr. Jang's Division Visit Probability</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem Description</h2>\r\n<p>Our freaky Dr. Jang spends the whole day visiting all divisions and solving problems they are faced with. Dr. Jang has his own philosophy: Spend exactly no more than 10 minutes in each division.</p>\r\n<p>He might stay for a while in one division, but in that case, his visit extends on a 10-minute basis.</p>\r\n<p>A probabilistic graph on Dr. Jang's movement is given. Below is one example:</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Jang stays for the first 10 minutes in division 1, moves to division 2 with the probability of 0.3 and spends the next 10 minutes, or he moves to division 3 with the probability of 0.7 and spends the next 10 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Do not consider the time it takes to move between divisions. There can be several arrows that come from one division, but the sum of the probabilities, written on them, must always be 1.</p>\r\n<p>The division Dr. Jang visits first after he gets to work in the morning is always division 1.</p>\r\n<p>Write a program that finds the division with the highest probability that Dr. Jang is in it and the probability when a random amount of time passed after he starts by visiting division 1.</p>\r\n<p>In the figure (graph not included in text, but implied by input format), the division with the highest probability that Dr. Jang is in it after 10 minutes is division 3 and the probability is 0.7.</p>\r\n<p>After 9 minutes when Dr. Jang has yet to move to another division, he is in division 1 and the probability is 1.0.</p>\r\n<p>Forty minutes later, the division with the highest probability is division 6 and the probability is 0.774.</p>\r\n<p>When Dr. Jang arrives at a division that does not have an outgoing arrow, the division is the last division to visit and Dr. Jang leaves after 10 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, when the graph is same as below (referring to an illustrative graph), Dr. Jang is not in any of the divisions after 50 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Input</h2>\r\n<p>10 test cases are given throughout. 20 lines with each test case consisting of two lines.</p>\r\n<p>The first line of each test case, N, the total number of divisions, E, the number of arrows that indicate the probability, and T, time integer are given. (1≤N≤100, 1≤E≤200, 0≤T≤1000).</p>\r\n<p>The next line has an enumeration of E-arrows. One arrow is marked as \"Starting Point End Point Probability\". The division numbers that indicate starting and end point is one of integers from 1 to N.</p>\r\n<p>The probability is a real number between 0 and 1.</p>\r\n<p>Time (T) is represented as an integer in minute.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if T is 8, it asks the location of Dr. Jang exactly 8 minutes after he starts his visit. 10 minutes after Dr. Jang starts his visit, he is in the 2nd division; 20 minutes later, he is in the 3rd division. This means, Dr. Jang is in division 1 from 0-9 minutes, and he is in the 2nd division from 10-19 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Adjacent numbers are separated by a space. There is no particular order in enumeration of arrows.</p>\r\n<p>The 10 test cases are given as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Cases 1-2:</strong> in a circular form with N divisions sequentially connected by arrows (arrow that goes from N to No. 1 exists as well).</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Cases 3-4:</strong> in addition to conditions for Cases 1-2, arrows that have the same starting and end points (for instance, if staying in the same division, 3 → 3) are added.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Cases 5-6:</strong> when N=30, and E=50 respectively, at most 2 arrows start from each division.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Cases 7-10:</strong> there are no restrictions for arrows or status of connection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Output</h2>\r\n<p>Print answers for each of the 10 test cases. Start each line with \"#x\" (where x is the test case number), leave a space and then write the answer.</p>\r\n<p>The answer consists of the division with the highest probability that Dr. Jang is in it and that probability.</p>\r\n<p>Divisions are integers and probabilities are real numbers, which will be separated by leaving a space in-between. When two or more divisions have the highest probability, print the lowest numbered division.</p>\r\n<p>If Dr. Jang is in neither division, simply print '0'. (Interpreted as '0 0.000000')</p>\r\n<p>For probability, your answer will be considered as correct if it has an absolute or relative error less than 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examples</h2>\r\n<h3>Example 1:</h3>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input:\r\n6 10 40\r\n1 2 0.3 1 3 0.7 3 3 0.2 3 4 0.8 2 4 1 4 5 0.9 4 6 0.1 5 6 1 6 3 0.5 6 6 0.5\r\n6 10 10\r\n1 2 0.3 1 3 0.7 3 3 0.2 3 4 0.8 2 4 1 4 5 0.9 4 6 0.1 5 6 1 6 3 0.5 6 6 0.5\r\n6 10 9\r\n1 2 0.3 1 3 0.7 3 3 0.2 3 4 0.8 2 4 1 4 5 0.9 4 6 0.1 5 6 1 6 3 0.5 6 6 0.5\r\n6 7 50\r\n1 2 0.3 1 3 0.7 2 4 1.0 3 4 0.7 3 6 0.3 4 5 1.0 5 6 1.0\r\n6 7 13\r\n1 2 0.3 1 3 0.7 2 4 1.0 3 4 0.7 3 6 0.3 4 5 1.0 5 6 1.0\r\n...\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n#1 6 0.774000\r\n#2 3 0.700000\r\n#3 1 1.000000\r\n#4 0 0.000000\r\n#5 3 0.700000\r\n...</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Constraints</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= N <= 100</code> (Number of divisions)</li>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= E <= 200</code> (Number of arrows)</li>\r\n    <li><code>0 <= T <= 1000</code> (Time in minutes)</li>\r\n    <li>Probabilities are real numbers between 0 and 1.</li>\r\n    <li>The sum of probabilities for outgoing arrows from any division must be 1.</li>\r\n    <li>Division numbers are from 1 to N.</li>\r\n    <li>The answer for probability will be considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error less than 10<sup>-6</sup>.</li>\r\n</ul>",
