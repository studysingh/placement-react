There are n host servers, where the throughput of the i<sup>th</sup> host server is given by host_throughput[i].</p>\\\\n\\\\n        <p>These host servers are grouped into clusters of size three. The throughput of a cluster, denoted as cluster_throughput, is defined as the median of the host_throughput values of the three servers in the cluster. Each host server can be part of at most one cluster, and some servers may remain unused.</p>\\\\n\\\\n        <p>The total system throughput, called system_throughput, is the sum of the throughputs of all the clusters formed. The task is to find the maximum possible system_throughput.</p>\\\\n\\\\n        <div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\\\\n            <h4>Note:</h4>\\\\n            <p>The median of a cluster of three host servers is the throughput of the 2nd server when the three throughputs are sorted in either ascending or descending order.</p>\\\\n        </div>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n    <div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"function-description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\\\\n        <h3>Function Description</h3>\\\\n        <p>Complete the function <code>getMaxThroughput</code> in the editor below.</p>\\\\n        \\\\n        <p><code>getMaxThroughput</code> has the following parameter:</p>\\\\n        <ul>\\\\n            <li><code>int host_throughput[]</code>: an array denoting the throughput of the host servers</li>\\\\n        </ul>\\\\n\\\\n        <h4>Returns</h4>\\\\n        <p><code>long</code>: the maximum system_throughput</p>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n    <div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"constraints\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\\\\n        <h3>Constraints</h3>\\\\n        <ul>\\\\n            <li>1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10<sup>5</sup></li>\\\\n            <li>1 ≤ host_throughput[i] ≤ 10<sup>9</sup></li>\\\\n        </ul>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n\\\\n    <div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"examples\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\\\\n        <h3>Examples</h3>\\\\n        \\\\n        <div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"example\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\\\\n            <h4>Sample Case 0:</h4>\\\\n            <pre class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">Input:\\\\nhost_throughput[] size n = 6\\\\nhost_throughput = [4, 6, 3, 5, 4, 5]</pre>\\\\n            <pre class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"output\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">Output:\\\\n9</pre>\\\\n            <div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"explanation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\\\\n                <p>Here, n = 6, and the host throughput is given by host_throughput = [4, 6, 3, 5, 4, 5].</p>\\\\n                <p>The maximum number of clusters that can be formed is 2.</p>\\\\n                <p>One possible way to form the clusters is to select the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> host servers for the first cluster, and the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup> host servers for the second cluster.
