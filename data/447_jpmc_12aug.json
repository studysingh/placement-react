Filters can be combined such that only frequencies within the permissible range of all filters can pass through.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, three filters with frequency ranges (10, 17), (13, 15), and (13, 17) will only allow frequencies between 13 and 15 to pass through, as this is the only overlapping range.</p>\r\n<p>Given <code>n</code> signal frequencies and a sequence of <code>m</code> filters with specified frequency ranges from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code> (inclusive), determine how many signals will pass through all the filters. There will be a single common range where all filters overlap.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examples</h2>\r\n<h3>Example 1:</h3>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input:\r\nfrequencies = [8, 15, 14, 16, 21]\r\nfiltersRanges = [[10, 17], [13, 15], [13, 17]]\r\nOutput: 2</code></pre>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The range that all of the filters allow through is from 13 to 15, inclusive. The 2 frequencies that will pass through all filters have frequencies of 15 and 14. Return 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Function Description</h2>\r\n<p>Complete the <code>countSignals</code> function in the editor with the following parameter(s):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><code>int frequencies[n]</code>: the frequencies of the signals sent through the filters</li>\r\n    <li><code>int filterRanges[m][2]</code>: the lower and upper frequency bounds for each filter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Returns:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><code>int</code>: the number of signals that pass through all filters</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Constraints</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= n <= 10^5</code></li>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= frequencies[i] <= 10^9</code></li>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= m <= 10^5</code></li>\r\n    <li><code>1 <= filterRanges[j][k] <= 10^9</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sample Case 0</h2>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input:\r\nn = 5\r\nfrequencies = [20, 5, 6, 7, 12]\r\nm = 3\r\nfilterRanges = [[10, 20], [5, 15], [5, 30]]\r\nOutput: 1</code></pre>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The common pass-through range is 10 to 15, so only frequency 12 passes through.</p>",
