In order to avoid server underload, the upgrade process, the server receives requests at certain time intervals and pause upgrades during those periods. The servers receive requests at multiples of req1 and req2 respectively. Determine the minimum total time in (in seconds) required to upgrade both servers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Only one server undergoes the upgrade process at any given second.</li>\r\n    <li>There may be seconds during which no server is undergoing an upgrade.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>req1 = 2\r\nt1 = 3\r\nreq2 = 3\r\nt2 = 1</code></pre>\r\n<p>The 1st server takes 3 seconds to upgrade, and it receives requests on seconds that are multiples of 2.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, the 2nd server upgrades in 1 second and receives requests on seconds that are multiples of 3.</p>\r\n<p>The 1st server upgrades in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th seconds, while the 2nd server upgrades in the 2nd second. Note that none of the numbers from [1, 3, 5] is divisible by req1 = 2. Similarly, [2] is not divisible by req2 = 3.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, the minimum time required is 5 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Function Description</h3>\r\n<p>Complete the function <code>getMinUpgradationTime</code> in the editor below.</p>\r\n<p><code>getMinUpgradationTime</code> takes the following parameter(s):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><code>int req1</code>: indicates that the first server receives requests at multiples of <code>req1</code></li>\r\n    <li><code>int t1</code>: the total time in seconds to upgrade the first server</li>\r\n    <li><code>int req2</code>: indicates that the second server receives requests at multiples of <code>req2</code></li>\r\n    <li><code>int t2</code>: the total time in seconds to upgrade the second server</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Returns</h3>\r\n<p><code>long</code>: the minimum total time (in seconds) required to upgrade both servers</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Constraints</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><code>2 &lt;= req1, req2 &lt;= 3 * 10^4</code></li>\r\n    <li><code>1 &lt;= t1, t2 &lt;= 10^9</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examples</h2>\r\n<h3>Example 1:</h3>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input:\r\nreq1 = 2\r\nt1 = 1\r\nreq2 = 2\r\nt2 = 3\r\nOutput: 7</code></pre>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The minimum total time will be 7 seconds; the first server upgrades at the 1st second, and the second server upgrades at the 3rd, 5th, and 7th seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Example 2:</h3>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input:\r\nreq1 = 3\r\nt1 = 2\r\nreq2 = 4\r\nt2 = 1\r\nOutput: 3</code></pre>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The minimum time required is 3 seconds; the first server upgrades at the 1st and 2nd seconds, and the second server upgrades at the 3rd second.</p>",
