To undertake this journey, you possess a limited but potent magical power represented by the integer \"power.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, traversing through the mystical realms is not an easy feat. The magical energy required to travel from one location to another is determined by the absolute difference between the powers of the two locations. It is crucial to note that your magical power level (initially represented by \"power\") must never deplete to zero or below during the quest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your mission is to determine the total number of viable paths from the \"start\" position to the \"finish\" position, taking into account the constraints of your magical power.
