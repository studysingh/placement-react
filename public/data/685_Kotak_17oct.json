This function takes the following 3 parameters and returns the required answer:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>N:</strong> Represents an integer denoting the number of products</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Q:</strong> Represents an integer denoting the number of customers</li>\r\n    <li><strong>query:</strong> Represents a 2D integer array of size Q*2 representing the query of the customer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Input format</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the input format that you must use to provide custom input (available above the Compile and Test button).</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.</li>\r\n    <li>For each test case:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>The first line contains an integer N.</li>\r\n            <li>The second line contains an integer Q.</li>\r\n            <li>The following Q lines contain 2 space-separated integers each, representing the 2D array query.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Output format</h2>\r\n<p>For each query of type 3, return an integer that is closest to the product asked and has been bought.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examples</h2>\r\n<h3>Example 1:</h3>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input:\r\n1\r\n5\r\n4\r\n1 5\r\n2 3\r\n3 6\r\n3 1\r\nOutput:\r\n5\r\n3</code></pre>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>\r\nInitially, no products are bought.\r\n1. <strong>Query 1 5:</strong> Products 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are bought.

(Counts: {1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:2, 5:2})\r\n3. <strong>Query 3 6:</strong> Search for most bought product >= 6. No products exist >= 6. The problem states \"product number greater than or equal to C\" and \"minimum difference from the C\". Given the sample output `5`, it implies that if no product >= C exists, it returns the most bought product overall, or the one closest to C from the existing products. Assuming it means the most bought product with ID >= C, and if none, then the most bought product overall. In this case, products 3, 4, 5 are most bought (count 2). Product 5 is closest to 6. So, output `5`.\r\n4. <strong>Query 3 1:</strong> Search for most bought product >= 1. Products 3, 4, 5 are most bought (count 2). Among them, product 3 is the smallest ID >= 1. So, output `3`.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Constraints</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>1 &le; T &le; 10</li>\r\n    <li>1 &le; N, Q &le; 10<sup>5</sup></li>\r\n    <li>1 &le; L, R, C &le; N</li>\r\n    <li>There will be at most 10<sup>5</sup> type 3 queries for each testcase.</li>\r\n</ul>",
