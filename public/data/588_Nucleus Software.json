Therefore 18 is returned as the output.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Example 2:</h3>\r\n<pre><code class='language-text'>Input: N = 10\r\nOutput: 190</code></pre>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Starting from 1, the minimum positive integer to be returned by the function is 190 which is divisible by 10; the sum of the digits of 190 is equal to 10, and 190 is not equal to 10. Therefore 190 is returned as the output.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Constraints</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>0 &lt; N &lt;= 100</li>\r\n</ul>",
