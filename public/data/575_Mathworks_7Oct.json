The subject matter of each lecture has a certain complexity. Alex has planned the order of lectures they would like to attend, but now they need to schedule these into several days. Their goal is to attend at least one lecture every day and to plan the lectures in a way that minimizes the overall complexity of the conference. (Each day's complexity is defined as the complexity of the most complex lecture attended that day.) Given the complexity levels of the lectures, as well as how many days the conference is being held, what is the overall minimum complexity that can be achieved with optimal planning?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function is expected to return an INTEGER.</p>\r\n<p>The function accepts the following parameters:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><code>INTEGER_ARRAY complexity</code>: an array of integers denoting the order and complexity of the lectures</li>\r\n    <li><code>INTEGER days</code>: the number of days the conference is being held</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Returns: <code>int</code>: the minimum overall complexity level that can be achieved with optimal planning</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examples</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Example 1:</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Input:</strong> <code>n = 5</code>, <code>complexity = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]</code>, <code>days = 2</code></p>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The best option is to attend the first lecture on the first day and the rest on the second day. The complexity of the first day would be 1, since that's the only lecture, and the complexity of the second day would be 5, because that's the complexity level of the most complex lecture that day.
